Recrusion -> memoization -> tabulation -> space optimization

memoization - top to bottom
tabulation - bottom-up 

Recursion -> solve every sub problem 
(there is overlapping of sub problems in recursion)
Memoization - tend to store the value of sub problems in some map / table.

Tabulation - bottom-up, from base case to required answer

Space optimizatoin - for space optimization, you need to find the pattern in the problem.
